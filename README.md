## Motivation
FPGA Acceleration can overcome the cache latency needed to commuicate with data in processing system, no off-chip memory bottleneck and most importantly parellelism with higher orders can be achieved. 

## Project Description 
The project consists of the following parts
- The floating point unit.
- The average pool FPGA implementation
    There are three versions developed:
    - No parallelism 
    - Three channels are implemented in parallel.
- The maxpool FPGA implementation
- The AXI interfacing to integrate the average pool with C application driver.
- The AXI interfacing to integrate the max pool with C application driver.


## Software and Hardware Environment

### Software Tools:

1. Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 IDE
2. Xilinx SDK

### Hardware Tools:

PYNQ-Z2 from TUL.
